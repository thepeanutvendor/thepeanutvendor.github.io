<p>There are two components to decision theory. Descriptive decision theory merely describes <em>how</em> people make decisions. Normative decision theory concerns what people <em>ought</em> to behave like. We can not judge decisions merely by outcome as rational decisions can often lead to harmful outcomes. This is because individuals&rsquo; decisions are often often constrained by limits to their knowledge, for instance.</p>
<p>Decision theory concerns individual decisions without taking into account other decision makers. Not all decisions operate under such conditions, and we have fields for other types. Social choice theory concerns decisions made collectively, and game theory concerns decisions made by multiple agents whose actions affect each other.</p>
<p>A decision made under risk is one where the decision-maker knows the probabilities of possible outcomes. A decision made under ignorance is one where the decision-maker does not know the probabilities of possible outcomes.</p>
