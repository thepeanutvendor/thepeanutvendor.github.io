Arguments

It is sunny. So I should take my sunglasses.
It must have been sunny. I did wear my sunglasses, after
all.
No one but you has had their hands in the cookie-jar. And
the scene of the crime is littered with cookie-crumbs. You’re
the culprit!
Miss Scarlett and Professor Plum were in the study at the
time of the murder. Reverend Green had the candlestick
in the ballroom, and we know that there is no blood on his
hands. Hence Colonel Mustard did it in the kitchen with
the lead pipe. Recall, after all, that the gun had not been
fired.

b.

Yes. &lsquo;All men are carrots&rsquo; above.
Yes. Argument 2 above.
Yes. Argument 4 above.
Yes. Add the premise &lsquo;If I do not pull the trigger, Abe Lincoln will not die&rsquo; to argument 3 and it will be made valid.
No.

Contingent.
Contingent.
Contingent.
Necessary truth.
Necessary falsehood.
Contingent.


b.

Contingent.
Contingent.
Necessary truth.
Necessary falsehood.
Necessary truth.


c. 1, 2, and 3
d. 2
e.

Jointly possible.
Jointly impossible.
Jointly possible.
Jointly possible.


f.

impossible.
impossible.
possible.
possible.
impossible.


g.

Possible.
Possible.
Possible. It is raining; it is not raining; therefore, it is raining and not raining.
Possible.
Impossible. Necessary truths are true in all cases, while contingent sentences are those that vary by case.
Possible. Piano players either have big hands or don&rsquo;t, Bud Powell the piano player either has big hands or doesnt.
Impossible. Contingent sentences can be true or false, whereas necessary truths are always true. There are cases where the former is false, and the latter true, therefore they cannot be necessarily equivalent.
Impossible. If two sentences are jointly impossible, they can not be true or false together - which is the main condition of necessary equivalence.
Impossible.
Possible, if the second sentence is a necessary falsehood?
